Using a Neural Network Surrogate Model
========================================

This tutorial is a demonstration of how to construct a MetaModel of a component using a neural network
surrogate. Generally, MetaModel capabilities are used to construct a low-cost replacement which can be
used instead of an expensive component. A more detailed description of this class can be found under
the source documentation for `MetaModel <http://openmdao.org/docs/srcdocs/packages/openmdao.lib.html#metamodel-py>`_. 

For this example, a component was written for the sine function. This component  has only one input and output,
which will be mimicked by the MetaModel. Had  there been additional variables, access to those would also be
available  through the MetaModel.

.. testcode:: NN_MetaModel_parts

    from openmdao.main.api import Assembly, Component, SequentialWorkflow
    from math import sin
        
    from openmdao.lib.datatypes.api import Float
    from openmdao.lib.drivers.api import DOEdriver
    from openmdao.lib.doegenerators.api import FullFactorial, Uniform
    from openmdao.lib.components.api import MetaModel
    from openmdao.lib.casehandlers.api import DBCaseRecorder
    from openmdao.lib.surrogatemodels.api import NeuralNet
       
    class Sin(Component): 
        
        x = Float(0,iotype="in",units="rad",low=0,high=20)
        
        f_x = Float(0.0,iotype="out")
        
        def execute(self): 
            self.f_x = .5*sin(self.x)

To create a MetaModel, we first define an assembly to work in. After we have  created an assembly, the MetaModel
component needs to be instantiated. In this example,  the MetaModel was instantiated as ``sin_meta_model``, making
it easy to identify.

.. testcode:: NN_MetaModel_parts

    class Simulation(Assembly):        
        def __init__(self):
                super(Simulation,self).__init__()
    
        #Components
        self.add("sin_meta_model",MetaModel())      
        self.sin_meta_model.surrogate = {"default":NeuralNet()}  
        self.sin_meta_model.surrogate_args = {"default":{'n_hidden_nodes':5}}
        self.sin_meta_model.model = Sin()        
        self.sin_meta_model.recorder = DBCaseRecorder()

Once the MetaModel component is in place, the first step is to fill the `surrogate` slot.  In this case we set the
default to ``NeuralNet``, meaning that all outputs would be modeled  with NeuralNet surrogate models. However,
surrogate models can be specified for  specific output variables (again see the source docs for MetaModel for more
details).

To pass arguments to the surrogate model, ``surrogate_args`` is used. For NeuralNet, the number of hidden nodes
within the neural network needs to be specified and is  currently set to 5. Note that it is specified that this
variable is attributed to the  `default` surrogate model. 

Only after the surrogate slot has been filled can you specify the component that is  being modeled. This is done by
placing the component in the slot called `model.`  For this case we are looking at the Sin component created
earlier, so this is what's  placed in the model slot. Once this has been put in, the MetaModel will now have the 
same inputs and outputs as our sine function. In this case that means that once the  model slot is filled with the
Sin component, MetaModel will have an input named `x` and an output named `f_x` (copied directly from the names in
the Sin components). 

Once the surrogate and model slots of the MetaModel have been filled, the MetaModel is ready for training. 

.. testcode:: NN_MetaModel_parts

        #Training the MetaModel
        self.add("DOE_Trainer",DOEdriver())
        self.DOE_Trainer.DOEgenerator = FullFactorial()
        self.DOE_Trainer.DOEgenerator.num_levels = 50
        self.DOE_Trainer.add_parameter("sin_meta_model.x")
        self.DOE_Trainer.case_outputs = ["sin_meta_model.f_x"]
        self.DOE_Trainer.add_event("sin_meta_model.train_next")
        self.DOE_Trainer.recorder = DBCaseRecorder()
        self.DOE_Trainer.force_execute = True
        
In this case, we're going to train with a DOEdriver called ``DOE_Trainer``.   We specify a FullFactorial
DOEgenerator, which creates a set of evenly spaced  points across an interval. We (somewhat arbitrarily) selected 50
points for our training set, specified by ``num_levels`` under the DOEgenerator. The proper training set is, of
course,  highly problem dependent. The training interval is based on the *low* and *high* values specified in the
Sin component, though they could have also been specified in the ``add_parameter`` call. 

When the ``train_next`` event is set, MetaModel passes the inputs to the model (i.e., Sin) to  be run. By adding the
``train_next`` event to the ``DOE_Trainer`` driver, the driver will set the ``train_next`` event in the MetaModel
driver for each iteration. The outputs generated by each training run are stored  to be used in the training of a
surrogate model. MetaModel stores the training data internally for its  own uses, but you can also specify an extra
CaseRecorder to store the training cases for your own analysis if you want.  Here this storage occurs via the use of
``caseiterdriver.py``, but you could use any CaseRecorder.

Finally, ``force_execute`` is set to ``True`` to ensure that the component will always run when its workflow is
executed. 

After you train a MetaModel, you want to do something with it. We just run a simple validation with another
DOEDriver called ``DOE_Validate``. This time, the Uniform  DOEGenerator was used.  This  provides a random sampling
of points from within the range of input variables.  Twenty  validation points are being used in this particular
case. 

Here, ``sin_calc`` is also added, so we can calculate an actual and a predicted value simultaneously. 

.. testcode:: NN_MetaModel_parts

        #MetaModel Validation
        self.add("sin_calc",Sin())
        self.add("DOE_Validate",DOEdriver())
        self.DOE_Validate.DOEgenerator = Uniform()
        self.DOE_Validate.DOEgenerator.num_samples = 20
        self.DOE_Validate.add_parameter(("sin_meta_model.x","sin_calc.x"))
        self.DOE_Validate.case_outputs = ["sin_calc.f_x","sin_meta_model.f_x"]
        self.DOE_Validate.recorder = DBCaseRecorder()
        self.DOE_Validate.force_execute = True
        
Notice that the ``train_next`` event is not added to the ``DOE_Validate`` driver, like it was for for the
training driver.  MetaModel automatically runs in `predict` mode when this event is not set. MetaModel will then
check  for training data which will be used to generate a surrogate model for the provided outputs, using the
given inputs. Since training data is required to run, the training mode must always  be run prior to the running
of predict mode. 

Now, the outputs of the MetaModel are the predicted outputs as determined by the surrogate 
model, NeuralNet. 

The last thing we do is specify the `iteration hierarchy` that controls the execution order of this example. (For
more information on iteration hierarchy, see `A More Complex Tutorial Problem
<http://openmdao.org/docs/complex/index.html>`_ or `Tutorial: MDAO Architectures
<http://openmdao.org/docs/mdao/index.html>`_.) The top driver in any workflow must be called `driver,`  as seen in
this example.  The type of workflow being executed is a sequential workflow,  meaning that it is a simple sequence
of components. 

.. testcode:: NN_MetaModel_parts

        #Iteration Hierarchy
        self.driver.workflow = SequentialWorkflow()
        self.driver.workflow.add(['DOE_Trainer','DOE_Validate'])
        self.DOE_Trainer.workflow.add('sin_meta_model')
        self.DOE_Validate.workflow.add('sin_meta_model')
        self.DOE_Validate.workflow.add('sin_calc')

The following figure visually shows the iteration hierarchy for this MetaModel.  Note that ``sin_meta_model``
appears in two workflows. This is necessary since in the training workflow  the MetaModel is trained, and within the
prediction workflow, that data is used to run the  MetaModel again to create a prediction.  Thus it must be added to
each workflow  separately.

Finally, the first two lines of the following code are required to actually run the  MetaModel.  The remaining code
is for accessing and printing the data. Using the data recorded  by the implementation of ``DBCaseRecorder()``, we
can access and print the run data. 

.. testcode:: NN_MetaModel_parts

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        
        sim = Simulation()
        sim.run()
                   
        #This is how you can access any of the data
        train_data = sim.DOE_Trainer.recorder.get_iterator()
        validate_data = sim.DOE_Validate.recorder.get_iterator()
        train_inputs = [case['sin_meta_model.x'] for case in train_data]
        train_actual = [case['sin_meta_model.f_x'] for case in train_data]
        inputs = [case['sin_calc.x'] for case in validate_data]    
        actual = [case['sin_calc.f_x'] for case in validate_data]  
        predicted = [case['sin_meta_model.f_x'] for case in validate_data]
    
    
        for a,p in zip(actual,predicted): 
            print "%1.3f, %1.3f"%(a,p)
